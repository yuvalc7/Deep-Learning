# Deep Learning
Our project on recognition of gender by voice 

#Data Set 
design of a computer program to model acoustic analysis of voices and speech for determining gender.
 The model is constructed using 3,168 recorded samples of male and female voices, speech, and utterances.
 The samples are processed using acoustic analysis and then applied to an artificial intelligence/machine learning algorithm to learn gender-specific traits.
 
# Algorithms used in project
  Logistic Regression - 91% 
  MLP - 94%
  RNN with LSTM - 94%

# Deep Learning
Our project on recognition of gender by voice 

# Data Set 
 design of a computer program to model acoustic analysis of voices and speech for determining gender.
 The model is constructed using 3,168 recorded samples of male and female voices, speech, and utterances.
 
 
# Algorithms used in project
